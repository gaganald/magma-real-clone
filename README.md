I'm thrilled to share my latest web project that combines the power of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Canvas element, all brought to life with the magic of Locomotive Scroll and GSAP ScrollTrigger.

Key Features:

Canvas Brilliance: I harnessed the expressive potential of the Canvas element to create mesmerizing visual effects that captivate and immerse visitors.
Locomotive Scroll Mastery: By implementing Locomotive Scroll, I achieved a buttery-smooth scrolling experience that seamlessly navigates through different sections, adding a touch of elegance to the user journey.
GSAP ScrollTrigger Magic: GSAP ScrollTrigger was the secret ingredient that breathed life into the site, adding animations, parallax effects, and delightful surprises that make every scroll a delightful discovery.
